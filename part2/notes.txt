- map creates new array
- elements generated by map need keys
- index as a key is an anti-pattern
- keys not necessarily defined in li elements, can
be defined in components that return li
<Note key={note.id} /> where Note returns li
- event.preventDefault() in event handlers prevent page reload
- event.target is which component triggered event
- Controlled Components, (ex: controlled input) are states controlled by user input (input, select, textarea)
